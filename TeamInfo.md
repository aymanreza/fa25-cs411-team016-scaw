## Project Summary

Our project is a weather app that combines real-time weather conditions with historical trends and date-specific forecasts. Anyone can check the current weather conditions for any location at any time for either a specific point in time, past or future, or over a chosen time frame. Future weather is predicted based on historical patterns and seasonal averages. Users can also create an account to build and save a personalized list of cities, by adding, removing, and even renaming locations. There is also a quarterly summary of the weather a user experiences, similar to Spotify Wrapped, but for the weather.

While other weather sites usually do 7 to 10 day forecasts, this app enhances the weather experience with historical context and customizable planning tools. Core features include viewing current and past weather, managing user profiles and saved locations, generating history-based predictions, seasonal summaries, and a customizable dashboard. The system uses real datasets like Meteostat, NOAA’S CDO (GHCN-Daily), and Open-Meteo’s Historical Weather Archive to provide daily and hourly weather stats to power its insights.
